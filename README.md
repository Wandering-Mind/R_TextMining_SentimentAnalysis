# R_TextMining_SentimentAnalysis
Text Mining Process +Sentiment Analysis of graduate-level rate my professor reviews

This document provides instructions for Homework 8, which involves text mining and sentiment analysis for two sets of text data related to Dr. Guder's courses at Loyola University of Chicago. Here is a summary of what you need to do:

Part 1:
Perform text mining and sentiment analysis on the text data "GuderLUC691.txt," which contains teacher/course evaluations for Dr. Guder's courses (ISSCM 491, BSAD 443, INFS 691) over the last three years.
Follow the four-step text mining process as presented in the example problem in the reading document and videos.
Remove specific words (professor, guder, course, class) using the provided R code.
Create a word cloud with the specified options.
Submit the HTML file created from the Rmd file used for Part 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13.
Part 2:
Perform text mining and sentiment analysis on the text data "GuderRMP.txt," which contains reviews posted on Rate My Professor (RMP) for Dr. Guder's courses.
Follow the same four-step text mining process as in Part 1.
Remove the same specific words using the provided R code.
Create a word cloud with the specified options.
Submit the HTML file created from the Rmd file used for Part 2 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24.

Part 3:
Prepare a 3-4 page summary report addressing the following:
Summary report for Part 1: Describe the analysis, data used, results observed (including visual displays), and sentiment results.
Summary report for Part 2: Describe the analysis, data used, results observed (including visual displays), and sentiment results.
Compare the sentiment values (positive words, negative words, sentiment scores, and sentiment ratios) between the two sets of reviews (LUC and RMP). Use the percent positive ratio for comparison.
Discuss any differences in sentiment ratios and possible conclusions about the reviews 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36.

The text mining process involves the following steps-

Text  
Data - Word

 The very first process involves collecting unstructured data. These can be from sources 
such as emails, websites, pdf, product reviews, audios, videos, and blogs. Read data and 
create data structure "corpus". 
 Removing unwanted data takes place next. This involves data cleansing, which removes all 
the unwanted parts from the data and extracts valuable information. 
 Then all the extracted data that is unstructured is converted to structured data (term 
document matrix). 
 Now the data is analyzed to find various hidden patterns and also process the outcomes. 
 The data extracted is then stored safely to be used for various purposes and future use. 
The text mining process steps will be presented by using the following text, which consists of the
